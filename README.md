## **3. Key Findings and Recommendations**  

ðŸ“Œ **Primary Reasons for Churn:** Competitors offering better devices and deals, followed by poor customer support, pricing issues, and flexible contracts.  

### **Demographics Analysis**  
- **Women over 50** have a high churn rate due to competitorsâ€™ superior devices.  
  - **Recommendation:** Improve device offerings and provide upgrade incentives.  
- **Men with a tenure of 18-24 months in Chhattisgarh** experience 100% churn due to pricing and service dissatisfaction.  
  - **Recommendation:** Adjust regional pricing and enhance customer support.  

### **Account Information Analysis**  
- **Mailed Check (37.8%) and Bank Withdrawal (34.4%)** have the highest churn rates.  
  - **Recommendation:** Encourage Credit Card payments with cashback/discount incentives.  
- **Month-to-month contracts have an almost 50% churn rate.**  
  - **Recommendation:** Offer discounts for long-term contracts to boost commitment.  

### **Service Usage Analysis**  
- **Fiber Optic internet has the highest churn rate (41.1%)**, likely due to service issues or cost.  
  - **Recommendation:** Enhance service quality and introduce flexible pricing plans.  
- **Customers not using value-added services** like Device Protection, Online Backup, and Security churn at higher rates.  
  - **Recommendation:** Promote bundled service packages at competitive prices.  
- **Churn remains high even among customers subscribed to Internet, Phone, and Unlimited Data.**  
  - **Recommendation:** Investigate service quality issues and conduct customer surveys.  

### **Churn Prediction for New Customers**
